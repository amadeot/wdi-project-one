Description:

The goats keep escaping!!! Whenever a goat gets out of the pen, you will be notified and you must click on it to get it back.


User Stories:

  a user should see 4 buttons on screen, a high score with my name and a score, a score counter and one start button.
  
  the user can press the start button, which after a slight delay, one of the buttons background image will turn into a goat and scream randomly.
  
  the user then will be able to click all four buttons.
  
  if they click the correct button it will turn into a goat and scream again randomly, score 1 point.
  
  two buttons will then goatify and scream in succession.
  
  the user then clicks those two buttons, and scores another point for completing the round, and they will score after each round.
  
  this keeps on going until the succession is broken by the user.
