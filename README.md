user stories

  a user should see 4 buttons on screen, a high score with my name and a score, a score counter and one start button
  
  the user can press the start button, which after a slight delay, one of the buttons background image will turn into a goat and scream randomly
  the user then will be able to click all four buttons.
  if they click the correct button it will turn into a goat and scream again randomly, score 1 point
  two buttons will then goatify and scream in succession, each goat worth 1 point
  the user then clicks those two buttons
  this keeps on going until the succession is broken by the user
  if score is higher than high score, user is notified that they have beaten the high score and is prompted to enter their name.
